# vscode Settings

When you use vscode for any projects, it will, usually, automatically create a hidden folder called `.vscode` in your project directory.  
Inside of this folder, there is usually two json files, namely, `c_cpp_properties.json` and `settings.json`.  
The example given here is a cpp project, therefore, there is the `c_cpp_properties.json` file.
